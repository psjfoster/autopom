### TODO
1. button (spacebar?) switches between both
1. button (P?) pauses both -- <ins>P</ins>iss break
1. ~~work clock counts up, "play" clock counts down~~
1. ~~set secs to mins, translated to **x : 1**~~
    - ~~secs elapsed adds full number of mins to second clock~~

## brief
Dual-clock (chess-style) timer for counting up time worked and accruing "play" minutes on a ratio-ed basis.
